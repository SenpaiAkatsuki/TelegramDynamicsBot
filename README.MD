Telegram bot I created back in 2023, right when Aiogram 3.0 was relesed. This bot is about run ads across multiple Telegram groups.
## Built With

- **Python**
- **Aiogram**
- **Redis**
- **Alembic**
- **Docker**
- **SQLalchemy**


# FIRST SETUP.

1. `docker-compose up`
    It will create the containers.
2. `CTRL + Z`
    It will detach from the containers.
3. `sh run_migrations.sh`
    It will run the migrations for the DB.
